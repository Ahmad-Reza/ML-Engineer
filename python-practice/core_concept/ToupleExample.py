# A tuple is like a list except that it uses parentheses () instead of square brackets []
# Touples are immutable (can't change the value once it's created).

# Mutable - mutable objects are those that can be changed/modified afer they are created.
# e.g List, Dictionary, sets

# Immutable - immutable objects are those that can't changed/modified after they created.
# e.g Integers, Floats, Strings, Touples
